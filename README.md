# IDS---Starter


Malicious attacks have become more complex and frequent in recent years as IoT-based critical
infrastructures (ex. Autonomous Transport System (ATS)) have grown larger and encompass different areas
of industry. Within the IoT systems themselves, the addition of various types of devices being monitored
and used on the overall IoT critical infrastructure has also grown and become more diverse [1]. Sensors for
monitoring systems to large devices are all part of the IoTs [2][3]. We have also seen a growth in intelligent
transport systems (ITS) usage through the utilization of vehicular network architecture. In the healthcare
space, we have seen an increase in IoT medical devices. With all these components now becoming
prominent, there is a need for proper monitoring. The large array of devices that are controlled, monitored,
or used produces networks that are full of security breaches.

On the other hand, the advances in cellular, wireless, Bluetooth, or LAN are all distributed networks that
give way to connecting many IoT devices [4]. Malicious users will always take advantage of any weak
point in the network, seeing as IoT devices can be connected to different types of network infrastructure
they become the prime access point for attack. Specifically, in ATS, an IoT edge device that is connected
both to Bluetooth and the main LAN infrastructure becomes an easy gateway to infiltrate.

Cybersecurity and privacy of these networks are of prime concern for the deployment and the successful
adoption in critical infrastructures. Similarly, futuristic technologies such as machines, federated, and
distributed Learning, and Blockchain are revolutionizing the system security solutions for their endless
benefits of enhancing the system’s intelligence and speeding up the computation process.

Network Intrusion has the potential to cause long-term damage to critical infrastructures’ network security
and sensitive data. The intrusion Detection System as a whole is a system that monitors network traffic for
suspicious activity and issues alert when such activity is discovered. It is a structure that manages many
different subsystems such as transportation, home, or business systems. Given this, many researchers
develop IDS that are application-specific for the components in the network they are trying to protect. IDS
might scan a host and can be recognized as Host-based IDS (HIDS) or a network-based IDS (NIDS) for
malicious activity or any policy penetration.
